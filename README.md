# Scheduling Policy Visualization Website

This project features an interactive web application that visualizes three fundamental scheduling algorithms used in operating systems: **Shortest Job First (SJF)**, **Round Robin (RR)**, and **First Come First Serve (FIFO)**. The platform allows users to input process details and observe how these scheduling algorithms manage execution in real-time.

## Features

- **Process Input**: Users can easily enter a list of processes, including their arrival times and burst times.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: The website supports the following three scheduling policies:
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: A non-preemptive algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time.
  - **Round Robin (RR)**: A preemptive algorithm that assigns a fixed time quantum to each process.
  - **First Come First Serve (FIFO)**: A non-preemptive algorithm where processes are executed in the order of their arrival.
- **Visualization**: The website generates a clear and interactive timeline for each scheduling algorithm, displaying the execution order and calculating waiting times for each process.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: JavaScript
